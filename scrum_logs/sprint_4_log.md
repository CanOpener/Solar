###Tuesday 21 / 04 /2015 -> Wednesday 22 / 04 / 2015###
Rushed to get everything finished due to our mistake of leaving the rest of teh wrok till the very end. Servers all run on the same instance and dummy data inserter code improved, controls on the client have been upgraded and navegation is in progress. No Trade done.
